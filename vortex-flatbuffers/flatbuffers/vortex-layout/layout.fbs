/// A `Layout` is a recursive data structure describing the physical layout of Vortex arrays in random access storage.
/// As a starting, concrete example, the first three Layout encodings are defined as:
///
/// 1. encoding == 1, `Flat` -> one buffer, zero child Layouts
/// 2. encoding == 2, `Chunked` -> zero buffers, one or more child Layouts (used for chunks of rows)
/// 3. encoding == 3, `Columnar` -> zero buffers, one or more child Layouts (used for columns of structs)
///
/// The `row_count` represents the number of rows represented by this Layout. This is very useful for
/// pruning the Layout tree based on row filters.
///
/// The `metadata` field is fully opaque at this layer, and allows the Layout implementation corresponding to
/// `encoding` to embed additional information that may be useful for the reader. For example, the `ChunkedLayout`
/// uses the first byte of the `metadata` array as a boolean to indicate whether the first child Layout represents
/// the statistics table for the other chunks. 
table Layout {
    /// The ID of the encoding used for this Layout.
    encoding: uint16;
    /// The number of rows of data represented by this Layout.
    row_count: uint64;
    /// Any additional metadata this layout needs to interpret its children.
    /// This does not include data-specific metadata, which the layout should store in a segment.
    metadata: [ubyte];
    /// The children of this Layout.
    children: [Layout];
    /// Identifiers for each `SegmentSpec` of data required by this layout.
