Vortex FFI API
==============

.. warning::
    This API should be considered entirely unstable. It _will_ change. Please reach out if a stable
    FFI API is important for your use-case and we can accelerate the process of stabilizing it.

..
   _TODO(ngates): we should split the header into sections and manually autodoc each function/typedef.
    Don't worry, Sphinx will yell at us if we forget one. It just allows us to partition the functions
    by module / usage.

   _TODO(ngates): we should use the tips/tricks for documenting which parameters are in/out.
    See https://hawkmoth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tips.html.
